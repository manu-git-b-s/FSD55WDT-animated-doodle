# FSD55WDT-Demo-2

This repository is created for giving demo on Git and Github.

Things I did for making this repository

- Create an empty respoitory named `Demo-2` in [Github](https://github.com/new)
- Copied the contents from from the page titled `create a new repository on the command line` and the other lines are

```
echo "# FSD55WDT-animated-doodle" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/manu-git-b-s/FSD55WDT-animated-doodle.git
git push -u origin main
```

- I have created an empty folder in my file explorer and opened the file in CMD.After opened CMD I just copy pasted and executed the lines one by one.
  - This first line `echo "# FSD55WDT-Demo-2" >> README.md` created an README.md file file with the content `"# git-and-github"`.
